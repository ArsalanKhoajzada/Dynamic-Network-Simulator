Purpose: This file serves as the main entry point for the Network Simulation application. 
         It provides a user interface to visualize a dynamic mesh network where routers adapt 
         to node and link failures. Users can observe real-time changes in network routing 
         and interact with the simulation.

Tech Stack Used:
- HTML5: For structuring the content of the web application
- CSS3: For styling and layout of the user interface
- JavaScript: For implementing the simulation logic and interactivity
- Vis.js: A JavaScript library for visualizing networks, providing a dynamic graph representation

    <h1>Dynamic Routing Mechanism Design in Faulty Network</h1>
    
    <p id="description">
        This simulation visualizes a mesh network where routers dynamically route traffic,
        adapting to node and link failures. Watch as the network adapts and find the shortest path
        between routers in real-time.
